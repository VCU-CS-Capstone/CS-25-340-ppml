# Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that allows computation on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This makes it particularly useful in privacy-preserving machine learning and cloud computing, as it enables the performance of complex operations on sensitive data without exposing it to unauthorized parties.

## Encryption & Decryption

* Data is encrypted using a public key, and anyone with this public key can perform computations on the ciphertext.
* Only the holder of the private key can decrypt the result of the computation to retrieve the output in plaintext.

## Types of Homomorphic Encryption

### Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)

Supports only one operation (either addition or multiplication) on ciphertexts. For example:

* RSA and ElGamal support multiplication.
* Paillier supports addition.
 
### Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE)

Supports a limited number of additions and multiplications.

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

Supports arbitrary numbers of both addition and multiplication operations, allowing complex computations on encrypted data. This is the most powerful form but also the most computationally expensive.

## Key Applications

* **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:** Enables training or inference on encrypted datasets, allowing machine learning models to work with sensitive data without ever revealing it.
* **Cloud Computing:** Allows users to outsource the storage and computation of encrypted data to the cloud while maintaining full privacy over the contents.
* **Secure Voting Systems:** Homomorphic encryption can be used to securely tally encrypted votes without exposing individual votes.

## Advantages

* **Data Confidentiality:** Computations can be performed on data without exposing it to third parties, such as cloud providers.
* **Security in Untrusted Environments:** Enables secure computations in environments where the data owner cannot fully trust the service provider.

## Challenges

* **Performance:** Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is computationally intensive and has high overhead in terms of processing time and storage.
* **Complexity:** Implementing FHE is much more complex than traditional encryption due to the number of supported operations and the need to ensure security against various types of attacks.

## Examples of Homomorphic Encryption Schemes:

* **BFV (Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren):** A widely used FHE scheme, which is more practical for real-world applications. It supports both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms.
* **CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song):** Specializes in approximate arithmetic on encrypted data and is suited for machine learning tasks that require floating-point numbers.

## Use in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:

Homomorphic encryption can be used to enable operations on encrypted datasets during the training or inference phase of a machine learning model. For example, a model can compute on encrypted data (like patient records or financial data) without ever decrypting it. This preserves the privacy of the underlying sensitive information while allowing valuable insights to be extracted.
